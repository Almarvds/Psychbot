# Psychbot
A mental health chatbot that helps with finding the best expert for any patient.

This project consists of a visual studio solution as well as an aiml library.
Visual studio can be downloaded using: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/ 

Before running the code make sure to add the reference to the aiml library.
If not automatically done for you, in your IDE implement a new reference, using the following path for the library: chatbot/bin/debug/aimlbot.dll
